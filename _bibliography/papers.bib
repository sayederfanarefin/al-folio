abstract="The Internet of Things can be defined as an expansion of Internet network further off conventional gadgets like computers, smart phones, and tablets to an assorted scope of gadgets and ordinary things that use embedded technology to communicate with the outer environment, all by means of the Internet. With the increasing time, data access and computing are proceeding towards more complications and hurdles requiring more efficient and logical data computation infrastructures but the vision of future IoT seems foggy as it is a matter of concern that our current infrastructure may not be able to handle large amount of data efficiently involving growing number of IoT devices. To get diminished from this issue, Fog computing has been introduced which is an expansion of cloud computing working as a decentralized infrastructure in which reserving or computing data, service, and applications are distributed in the most efficient and logical position between source and the cloud. In this paper, the current infrastructure has been depicted and proposed another model of IoT infrastructure to surpass the difficulties of the existing infrastructure, which will be a coordinated effort of Fog computing amalgamation with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) intelligent communication protocol followed by incorporation of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and finally integration of agent-based SOA. This model will have the capacity to exchange data by breaking down dependably and methodically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity in less measure of time maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) precisely.",

abstract="The Internet of Things(IoT) is the future Internet evolution towards a network of interconnected smart objects such as computers, smart phones, smart watches, smart televisions, smart cars and many more. It is a matter of concern that our current infrastructure may not be able to handle large amount of data efficiently involving the growing number of smart IoT devices. As a solution, in this paper we came up with proposing a hybrid model of IoT infrastructure, as compared to the existing infrastructure to overcome its challenges. Our proposed infrastructure will be a collaboration of Fog computing combined with intelligent use of Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) which will be serving as a machine to machine communication protocol. This model will be able to transfer data reliably and systematically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity and maintaining the Quality of Service(QoS) befittingly.",

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are at the heart of many of today's most innovative technologies. With companies investing lots of resources to design, build and optimize these networks for their custom products, DNNs are now integral to many companies' tightly guarded Intellectual Property. As is the case for every high-value product, one can expect bad actors to increasingly design techniques aimed to uncover the architectural designs of proprietary DNNs. This paper investigates if the power draw patterns of a GPU on which a DNN runs could be leveraged to glean key details of its design architecture. Based on ten of the most well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, we study this line of attack under varying assumptions about the kind of data available to the attacker. We show the attack to be highly effective, attaining an accuracy in the 80 percentage range for the best performing attack scenario.},
