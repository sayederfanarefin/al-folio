I am a PhD candidate at Texas Tech University. My advisor is Dr. Abdul Serwadda. My research is focused on Cyber-security. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering in 2017 from BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from BRAC University. 

I work as a Grad Part-Time Instructor at Tech. 
I am open to collaborations.
I love music and I play the drums when I get some free time (!)
