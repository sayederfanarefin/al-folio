Utilizing a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microphone with an extensive frequency range, we demonstrate that the distinct sounds produced during DNN operations can inadvertently reveal significant details about the network‚Äôs architecture. Through extensive experimentation with a variety of neural networks from the ImageNet competition, we validate the efficacy of this novel attack vector. Our contributions include a detailed methodological framework for capturing and analyzing acoustic data, empirical validation using prominent ImageNet models, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the attack‚Äôs robustness under varying conditions. This research not only uncovers a previously unexplored vulnerability in neural network security but also provides a foundation for developing more robust defense mechanisms against such innovative side-channel attacks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1007/978-981-10-5523-2_5" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">IoT Infrastructure: Fog Computing Surpasses Cloud Computing</div> <div class="author">Ashrafi, Tasnia H.,¬†Hossain, Md.

With the increasing time, data access and computing are proceeding towards more complications and hurdles requiring more efficient and logical data computation infrastructures but the vision of future IoT seems foggy as it is a matter of concern that our current infrastructure may not be able to handle large amount of data efficiently involving growing number of IoT devices. To get diminished from this issue, Fog computing has been introduced which is an expansion of cloud computing working as a decentralized infrastructure in which reserving or computing data, service, and applications are distributed in the most efficient and logical position between source and the cloud. In this paper, the current infrastructure has been depicted and proposed another model of IoT infrastructure to surpass the difficulties of the existing infrastructure, which will be a coordinated effort of Fog computing amalgamation with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) intelligent communication protocol followed by incorporation of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and finally integration of agent-based SOA.

Cloud computing is a centralized Internet based computing model which acts like a storage as well as a network connection bridge between end devices and servers. Cloud computing has been ruling as a data computation model for quite a while but if we try to concentrate on the upcoming IoT generation, the vision will become a little bit blurry as it is not possible for the present cloud computing models to deal with such huge amount of data and to rescue from this foggy situation, Fog computing model comes forward. Instead of being a replacement of the cloud computing model, Fog computing model is an extension of Cloud which works as a distributed decentralized computing infrastructure in which data compute, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. In this paper, we proposed an infrastructure with collaboration of Fog computing combined with Machine-to-Machine(M2M) intelligent communication protocol followed by integration of the Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and this model will be able to transfer data by analyzing reliably and systematically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity in less amount of time maintaining the Quality of Service(QoS) befittingly.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="8559936" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Image Processing Based Indoor Localization System for Assisting Visually Impaired People</div> <div class="author">Heya, Tasnia Ashrafi,¬† <em>Arefin, Sayed Erfan</em>,¬†Chakrabarty, Amitabha,¬†and Alam, Mazidul </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2018 Ubiquitous Positioning, Indoor Navigation and Location-Based Services (UPINLBS)</em> Mar 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Indoor localization or indoor positioning system is a known as a process of detecting position of any object or people inside a building or room by different sensory data collected from different devices using different techniques such as radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals or other procedures. However, lacking of a standard localization system is still a very big concern. Solution of this issue can be very beneficial for people in many cases but it can be especially very beneficial for the visually impaired people. In this paper, an image processing based indoor localization system has been developed using OpenCV and Python by following color detection technique to detect position of the user with maximum accuracy and then location of user is determined by analyzing that location matrix. Location accuracy depends on the size of the matrix and successful identification of target color. Firebase real time database was added to the system which made real time operations between server and the user end device easier. To justify the proposed model, successful experiments were conducted in indoor environments as well and correct result was achieved each time by detecting accurate locations. This will be very advantageous to observe the fully or partially sightless people and guide them towards their destination and also to inspect them for their security purpose.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3437880.3460415" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Deep Neural Exposure: You Can Run, But Not Hide Your Neural Network Architecture!</div> <div class="author"> <em>Arefin, Sayed Erfan</em>,¬†and Serwadda, Abdul </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security</em> Mar 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are at the heart of many of today‚Äôs most innovative technologies.

As is the case for every high-value product, one can expect bad actors to increasingly design techniques aimed to uncover the architectural designs of proprietary DNNs. This paper investigates if the power draw patterns of a GPU on which a DNN runs could be leveraged to glean key details of its design architecture. Based on ten of the most well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, we study this line of attack under varying assumptions about the kind of data available to the attacker.
