This study zeroes in on this underexplored facet by examining ChatGPT‚Äôs consistency when answering identical queries repeatedly. Employing a robust set of 741 questions, each reiterated 15 times, we deploy an array of analytical metrics to dissect the model‚Äôs consistency profile. Our investigation provides a novel benchmark for ChatGPT‚Äôs accuracy within a repetitive context, marking a departure from the prevalent approach of assessing LLMs across diverse single-instance prompts. The outcomes of this study are instrumental in delineating the robustness of state-of-the-art LLMs in scenarios where reliable consistency is imperative, such as educational contexts and critical decision-making processes.

However, lacking of a standard localization system is still a very big concern. Solution of this issue can be very beneficial for people in many cases but it can be especially very beneficial for the visually impaired people. In this paper, an image processing based indoor localization system has been developed using OpenCV and Python by following color detection technique to detect position of the user with maximum accuracy and then location of user is determined by analyzing that location matrix. Location accuracy depends on the size of the matrix and successful identification of target color. Firebase real time database was added to the system which made real time operations between server and the user end device easier. To justify the proposed model, successful experiments were conducted in indoor environments as well and correct result was achieved each time by detecting accurate locations.

In this paper, we depicted the current infrastructure and proposed another model of IoT infrastructure to surpass the difficulties of the existing infrastructure, which will be a coordinated effort of Fog computing amalgamation with Machine-to-Machine(M2M) intelligent communication protocol followed by incorporation of Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and finally integration of Agent based SOA. This model will have the capacity to exchange data by breaking down dependably and methodically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity in less measure of time maintaining the Quality of Service(QoS) precisely.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2025 Sayed Erfan Arefin.
